# RuneAtlas

Next.js web interface for browsing game data extracted from Ragnarok M Classic (ROMC).
Data comes from the JSONs generated by `romc-data-extractor` and loaded into a local MongoDB.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- MongoDB running (use the `docker-compose.yml` in the root of the repository)
- Data imported via `python -m romc_data_extractor.mongo_loader`

## Setup

1. Create the `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Pages

- `/` — Quick search and overview.
- `/items` — Browse by category (equipment, cards, consumables, etc.) with search.
- `/items/[id]` — Item detail with descriptions and raw data.
- `/monsters` — Filter by race, element, and name.
- `/monsters/[id]` — Monster detail with stats, drops, and skills.

## Search API
